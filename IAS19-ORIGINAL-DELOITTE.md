## Introduction

IAS 19 is the IFRS® Standard that shall be applied by an employer in accounting for employee benefits.

The objective of IAS 19 is to prescribe the accounting and disclosure for employee benefits.

Select each tab to find out more.

### What are employee benefits?

Employee benefits cover all forms of consideration given by an entity in exchange for service rendered by employees or for the termination of employment.

### What is the main principle of IAS 19?

The main principle underlying all of the detailed requirements of IAS 19 is that the cost of providing employee benefits shall be recognized in the period when services are provided, rather than when it is paid or payable. The Standard outlines how each category of employee benefits are measured, providing detailed guidance in particular about post-employment benefits.

### What are the benefits to you of working through this module?

By working through this module, you will gain the ability to:

• Deal with the accounting treatment required under IAS 19 for employee benefits; and

• Deliver improved client service through the provision of advice and knowledge.

## The scope of IAS 19

IAS 19 should be applied by an employer in accounting for all employee benefits.

[Diagram showing: Employer ← Services → Employee, with Benefits flowing from Employer to Employee]

Select the tab to find out more.

### The scope

IAS 19 does not deal with reporting by employee benefit plans (which is addressed in IAS 26 Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans).

The Standard applies to all employee benefits, except those to which IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment applies. The employee benefits to which the Standard applies include those provided:

• Under formal plans or other formal agreements between an entity and employees or their representatives;

• Under legislative requirements or through industry arrangements; or

• By those informal practices that give rise to a constructive obligation.

---

## Accounting issues concerning post-employment benefits

Accounting for post-employment benefits has received enhanced scrutiny in many countries since low interest rates and lower-than-expected investment returns have often resulted in:

• Larger defined benefit obligations; and

• Underfunding of those obligations.

IAS 19 would reveal whether an entity's post-employment benefit plan is currently in deficit (i.e., plan assets do not cover employees' benefit obligations) and it could adversely affect the entity's equity.

## Background of TurnStyle Group

TurnStyle is a small European group operating in the fashion industry. It is a retailer of apparel and accessories for young adults, and it has rapidly increased its market share in this target market over the last few years.

However, recently there has been a general downturn in the fashion industry mainly caused by a fall in consumer confidence in response to a weak economy. Sales in December, usually a bumper month for TurnStyle, were especially disappointing.

While market share has remained the same during the slowdown, revenues have fallen. A slow recovery is expected over the next few years.

# Scenario 1: An assortment of employee benefits

## Learning objectives

In this session, you will learn about the key requirements for short-term employee benefits, post-employment benefits, and the accounting treatment for defined contribution plans.

After completing this session, you will be able to:

• Identify short-term employee benefits and apply the accounting treatment for short-term employee benefits;

• Describe the key features of defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and other long-term employee benefits and distinguish the key difference between the plans and long-term employee benefits; and

• Describe and apply the accounting treatment for defined contribution plans.

## At TurnStyle Group

It is a normal day at the head office of TurnStyle Group, after a relaxing Christmas break. As the Group Accountant, you're busy collecting all the data for the year-end accounts.

Catalina, the Head of the Payroll Department, seems agitated.

Catalina: "I don't know what to do. My assistant, Mark, has gone off on a six-week holiday and he has left without saying anything...."

It turns out that Mark's friend, Mauwli, won first prize and a vacation for two in a national competition, but Mauwli broke up with his girlfriend shortly before departure, and Mark was the lucky last minute replacement. He only had a few hours to pack his suitcase.

## Short-term employee benefits

### What are short-term employee benefits?

This learning topic explains what short-term employee benefits are and reviews the accounting treatment for them.

Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service.

[Timeline diagram showing: Period end (31 December 20X1) expected to be wholly settled before → 12 months after the period end (31 December 20X2)]

---

## Short-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Accounting treatment

An entity shall recognize the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for employee service during the accounting period:

• As a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid; and

• As an expense, unless another IFRS Standard requires or permits its inclusion in the cost of an asset (e.g., IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment).

However, if the amount paid exceeds the undiscounted amount of the benefits, the entity shall recognize this excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payments or cash refund.

---

## Short-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Short-term compensated absences

IAS 19 provides the recognition and measurement requirements for short-term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences and profit sharing or bonus plans.

An entity may compensate employees for absences for various reasons (e.g., vacation, sickness, maternity, or jury service). Entitlement to compensated absences can be accumulating or non-accumulating.

[Diagram showing: Compensated absences → Accumulating | Non-accumulating]

Select each highlighted item to find out more.

### Accumulating

Accumulating compensated absences can be carried forward by an employee and used in future periods if the current period's entitlement is not used in full (e.g., legal paid vacation).

An entity should recognize the expected cost of such absences when the employees render a service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences. The expected cost is the additional amount that the entity expects to pay due to the accumulated entitlement at the end of the reporting period.

If employees are not entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving the entity, the possibility that they may leave affects the measurement of the obligation.

### Non-accumulating

Non-accumulating compensated absences cannot be carried forward by an employee (e.g., maternity leave or sick pay if unused past entitlement does not increase future entitlement).

Any unused entitlement is lost at the end of the current period or when the employee leaves the entity.

An entity should recognize the expected cost of such absences when the absences occur because employee service does not increase the amount of the benefit.

---

## Short-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Example: Accumulating compensated absences

Pietrus Co. has 100 employees, who are each entitled to 10 working days of paid leave each year. Unused paid leave may be carried forward for one calendar year (i.e., these are accumulated compensated allowances). Paid leave is taken first out of the current year's entitlement and then out of any balance brought forward (on a last-in, first-out basis).

At 31 December 20X1, the average amount of unused leave is two days per employee.

In 20X2, Pietrus Co. expects the utilization rate of paid leave to follow the pattern of previous years. Therefore, it expects that 92 employees will take no more than 10 days of paid leave and that eight employees will take an average of 11.5 days each. What liability should Pietrus Co. recognize for paid leave at 31 December 20X1?

---

## Short-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Example: Accumulating compensated absences (cont.)

An entity recognizes short-term employee benefits in the form of accumulating compensated absences when employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences. Hence, at 31 December 20X1, Pietrus Co. recognizes a liability equal to 12 days of paid leave. Pietrus Co. expects to pay an additional 12 days of leave due to the unused entitlement at 31 December 20X1 (1.5 days each, for eight employees). Pietrus will also record an additional expense in 20X1 for any change in the liability during 20X1.

If employees could carry forward paid leave indefinitely, and were entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving Pietrus Co. (i.e., a vested entitlement), then 200 days (two days each, for 100 employees) would be accrued at 31 December 20X1.

---

## Short-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Profit sharing and bonus plans

An entity shall recognize the expected cost of profit sharing and bonus payments when, and only when:

• The entity has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past events; and

• A reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.

---

## Post-employment and other long-term benefits

### Another two categories of employee benefits

This learning topic briefly describes and compares two categories of employee benefits:

• Post-employment benefits; and

• Other long-term benefits.

Post-employment benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits and short-term employee benefits) which are payable after the completion of employment.

Other long-term employee benefits are all employee benefits other than short-term employee benefits, post-employment benefits, and termination benefits.

Select each image to find out more.

[Image: Post-employment benefits]
[Image: Other long-term employee benefits]

### Post-employment benefits

Some examples of post-employment benefits are:

• Retirement benefits, such as pensions;

• Post-employment life insurance; and

• Post-employment medical care.

Arrangements whereby an entity provides post-employment benefits are called post-employment benefit plans.

### Other long-term employee benefits

Some examples of other long-term employee benefits are:

• Sabbatical leave;

• Jubilee (e.g., a bonus payable for 15 years of service);

• Long service bonuses;

• Long-term disability benefits; and

• Profit sharing, bonuses, or deferred compensation payable 12 months or more after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service.

---

## Post-employment and other long-term benefits (Cont.)

### Two types of post-employment benefit plans

IAS 19 specifies two types of post-employment benefit plans. Classification depends on the economic substance of the plan.

Select each tab to find out more.

### Defined contribution plans

Defined contribution plans are those under which:

• An entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund); and

• Has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

### Defined benefit plans

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than those meeting the definition of defined contribution plans.

---

## Post-employment and other long-term benefits (Cont.)

### A comparison

Select each tab to find out more.

### Defined contribution plans

Defined contribution plans have terms that specify how contributions to the individual's accounts are to be determined, rather than the amount of post-employment benefits the individual is to receive. For example, the employer may contribute 3% of pre-tax income into the plan.

Under defined contribution plans:

• The entity's legal or constructive obligation is limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute;

• The amount of the post-employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid together with investment returns; and

• Actuarial risk (that benefits will be less than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected benefits) fall on the employee.

### Defined benefit plans

Defined benefit plans indicate the amount of post-employment benefits that an employee will receive after employment, usually as a function of factors such as, age or years of service. For example, participants in such a plan may receive annual benefit payments of 1% of the final year's pay for each year of service, payable for the remainder of the participant's life.

Under defined benefit plans:

• It is the entity's obligation to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees; and

• Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected benefits) fall on the entity.

---

## Post-employment and other long-term benefits (Cont.)

### Multi-employer plans, state plans, and insured benefits

IAS 19 gives specific guidance on the classification of:

• Multi-employer plans;

• State plans; and

• Insured benefits.

Each plan must be classified as either a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan, based on the entity's obligation and the terms under the plan.

The images reveal more details on the accounting treatments for these three plans.

Select each image to find out more.

[Image: Multi-employer plans]
[Image: State plans]
[Image: Insured benefits]

### Multi-employer plans

Multi-employer plans are post-employment benefit plans (other than state plans) that:

• Pool the assets contributed by various entities that are not under common control; and

• Use those assets to provide benefits to employees of more than one entity.

Contribution and benefit levels are not related to which entity employs the employees concerned. If such a plan is a defined benefit plan, an entity accounts for its proportionate share of the obligation, assets, and costs in the same way as for any other defined benefit plan. If sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting, defined contribution accounting shall be used and additional disclosures are required.

### State plans

State plans (e.g., national social security plans) are established by legislation to cover all entities (or those in a category, e.g., a specific industry) and are operated by government or by a body that is not subject to control or influence by the reporting entity.

An entity shall account for state plans in the same way as it accounts for multi-employer plans.

Most state plans are defined contribution plans as, usually, an entity's only obligation is to pay contributions when they are due. If the entity ceases to employ members of the state plan, it has no obligation to pay benefits earned by its own employees in previous years.

### Insured benefits

An entity may pay insurance premiums to fund a post-employment benefit plan. The entity shall treat such a plan as a defined contribution plan, unless the entity will have a legal or constructive obligation to either:

• Pay the employee benefits directly when they fall due; or

• Pay further amounts if the insurer does not pay all the future employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

If the entity retains such a legal or constructive obligation, the entity shall treat the plan as a defined benefit plan.

## Defined contribution plans

### Basic principle

Under a defined contribution plan, an entity's obligation is determined by the amount to be contributed to the plan for the period. When an employee has rendered service during a period, the entity recognizes the contribution payable in exchange for that service:

Select each box in turn to find out more.

### In profit or loss

In profit or loss as an expense, unless another IFRS Standard requires or permits its inclusion in the cost of an asset e.g., IAS 2 Inventories or IAS 16; and ...

### In the statement of financial position as a liability

In the statement of financial position as a liability (accrued expense) after deducting any contribution paid; or ...

### In the statement of financial position as an asset

In the statement of financial position as an asset (prepaid expense), if the payment exceeds the contributions due, to the extent that the prepayment will be recoverable, e.g., by reduced future payments or a cash refund, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan and any statutory requirements in the jurisdiction of the plan (refer to IFRIC 14 IAS 19—The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction).

---

## Defined contribution plans (Cont.)

### Example: Defined contribution accounting

Under a defined contribution plan, Causeway Group pays a contribution equal to 10% of salaries. Once the contributions have been paid, Causeway Group has no further payment obligations.

The following details are available:

• Total salaries paid in 20X1: $100,000;

• Total payments into the plan for 20X1: $11,000;

• Liability (accrued expense) for outstanding contributions at 31 December 20X0: $500; and

• Any prepaid contributions into the plan will reduce future payments.

What expense and asset/liability, if any, should be recognized under this plan?

Select the image to find out more.

### Expense and asset/liability

The contribution due for the year is equal to 10% of the salaries: $100,000 x 10% = $10,000.

Therefore, in 20X1, the expense for pensions is equal to $10,000.

At 31 December 20X1, an asset should be recognized for $500, representing a prepayment of contributions, which is recoverable.

The asset is the excess of the total payments ($11,000) over the contribution due for the year ($10,000) and the brought forward liability ($500).

## What a mess!

Catalina has asked to see you. Apparently, Mark has quite a lot of responsibilities. Catalina controls the payroll run, staff queries, and correspondence with subsidiaries, but Mark deals with most employment benefits of the head office and those employee benefits that are not related to specific subsidiaries. He is good with figures.

Select each image to view the conversation.

### Catalina: 
"Hi! Thanks for coming to see me. The thing is ... well ... to be honest, I am covering for Mark, and I'm having trouble understanding some of his figures. I am afraid that compiling the year-end information from his file is a bit of a challenge for me at the moment."

### Catalina:
"He did leave his cell phone number, but Mia in reception has been trying to get hold of him all morning and she can't get through. I would appreciate it if you can give me some guidance on what needs to be done...."

### Catalina:
"The accounting treatment under IAS 19 for short-term employee benefits seems quite straightforward. However, I'm unsure which head office benefits are short-term employee benefits. Can you help me?"

---

## Scenario question: Which benefits are short-term?

Catalina has made a list of all the benefits she believes could be short-term benefits (see below). She is happy that the other head office benefits, which she hasn't listed, are not short-term as they are payable over many years or are not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after 20X2 year-end. To help her classify the benefits in her list, decide which items are clearly short-term benefit.

Select and drag each option into the best column and then click submit.

Options to classify:
- Paid sick leave and paid maternity leave
- Deferred compensation earned in 20X2 and payable 15 months after the 20X2 year-end
- Paid annual leave
- Cash bonus payable in January 20X3 on results obtained for 20X2
- Wages, salaries, and social security contributions
- Medical care for current employees

| Short-term benefits | Other long-term benefits |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
|                    |                       |

### Correct answers:
**Short-term benefits:**
- Paid sick leave and paid maternity leave
- Paid annual leave
- Cash bonus payable in January 20X3 on results obtained for 20X2
- Wages, salaries, and social security contributions
- Medical care for current employees

**Other long-term benefits:**
- Deferred compensation earned in 20X2 and payable 15 months after the 20X2 year-end

### Feedback: Correct
Well done! You selected the correct responses.

Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related services. They include all forms of consideration given by an entity in exchange for services by employees, including non-monetary benefits, such as car allowances.

All of the benefits in the list meet the definition above, apart from the deferred compensation which is payable more than 12 months after the year in which the service occurred.

Catalina thanks you and returns to her desk.

## Scenario question: Head office holiday

A few minutes later, Catalina walks over to you again. She has been able to calculate all of the accruals for benefits due within 12 months, apart from that for the head office annual leave. She would like your help with the journal entries.

Select the document icon to view the details of the annual leave in Catalina's file notes.

Select and drag the best responses from the suggestions below into the blanks and then click Submit.

The total liability to be recognized for the head office annual leave in the financial statements at 31 December 20X1 should be **Answer 1**.

The total expense to be recognized for annual leave during the year is **Answer 2**.

Options:
- $400
- $4,480
- $20,400
- $24,480

### Catalina's file notes - Annual leave – Head Office Staff

• Financial year ended 31 December 20X1.
• Total number of head office employees at both 31 December 20X0 and 31 December 20X1 was 50.
• At 31 December 20X0, the average amount of unused leave was 5 days per employee.
• At 31 December 20X0, the entity recognized a liability equal to $20,000.
• The average salary increase on 1 January 20X1 was 2%.
• During the year 20X1, the average amount of annual leave taken was 14 days per employee, which included all leave carried forward from 20X0.

Extract from a standard contract employment for head office staff:
"4.2 Annual Leave
In addition to all general holidays, you will be allowed 15 days of paid annual leave each year in accordance with the policy below.
Annual leave is accrued after the completion of one month's service. Accrual of annual leave is limited to your annual leave entitlement. If you have accrued annual leave days exceeding your annual entitlement, your excess balance will be forfeited on the 31 December every year."

### Correct Answer

The correct answer is:

In fact, the expense to be recognized for annual leave is the increase in the liability during the year.

**Liability 20X1**
= Liability 20X0 x salary rise x accrued days 20X1/accrued days 20X0
= $20,000 x (100% + 2%) x 6/5 = **$24,480**

**Accumulated days 20X1**
= Accumulated days 20X0 + annual entitlement − leave taken during 20X1
= 5 + 15 − 14 = 6

Therefore, the expense is **$4,480** (= $24,480 − $20,000)

Well, Mark would have needed to accumulate all 15 days of his paid annual leave entitlement from the prior year to enable him to take a six-week holiday this year, without taking any unpaid leave....

**Final answers:**
- **Answer 1 (Liability at 31 Dec 20X1)**: $24,480
- **Answer 2 (Expense for the year)**: $4,480

## Other employee benefits

Catalina: "Thank you so much. I have another problem though—the details for some of the other employee benefits are outstanding. Could you help me classify the different benefits, so I can determine the appropriate accounting treatment for them? I can't tell you how much I'd appreciate it...."

As Catalina passes you the relevant section from the group payroll manual, which contains the details about the types of employee benefits, her phone rings.

It's Mia. She has established a connection with Mark's mobile phone. Catalina passes the phone to you.

### Mia's message - Subject: You're through to Mark

"Hi, it's Mia. I've tried Mark's number again and it's finally ringing...."

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please try again later."

### Group long-term employee benefits details

**Benefit A (Group scheme)**
The employer pays 10% of an employee's gross annual remuneration into the fund. Upon retirement, employees receive a pension (part of which may be taken as a lump sum on retirement date) calculated by a formula based on years of service and final annual salary.

**Benefit B (Subsidiary scheme)**
In their contract, employees are allowed to receive a lump sum benefit payable on termination of service and equal to 1% of final salary for each year of service. The premiums payable by the entity are not fixed in advance.

**Benefit C (Group scheme)**
The employing entity is required to pay a contribution equal to 5% of salaries into a plan. Once the contributions have been paid, the entity has no further payment obligations. After retirement, employees are entitled to receive contributed amounts plus returns.

**Benefit D (Subsidiary scheme)**
The employer pays a contribution equal to 3% of salaries to the state plan for pensions. The employees or retirees will receive their pensions from the state plan upon retirement.

**Benefit E (Group scheme)**
Employees are entitled to a bonus equal to 1% of current salary after 15 years of service.

**Benefit F (Subsidiary scheme now closed in favor of Benefit C)**
Contributions are paid for by the employer and the employees. The employee contributions are deducted from salary and are calculated as a percentage of the annual salary between 6% and 10% based on age and years of service with the entity.
The employing entity's contributions are variable and amount from 100% to 200% of the employee contributions depending on the financial situation of the pension fund.
The pension plan formula is based on years of contributions and final covered salary. The benefits covered include retirement benefits, disability, death, and survivor pension.

## Scenario question: An assortment of head office benefits

IAS 19 has different accounting treatments for defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, or other long-term employee benefits. To determine the appropriate treatment, you need to classify the employee benefits in the extract from the group payroll manual that Catalina gave you. To retrieve the benefits details that Catalina gave you, you can select Resources.

Select and drag each option into the best column, and then click Submit.

Options to classify:
- Benefit A
- Benefit B  
- Benefit C
- Benefit D
- Benefit E
- Benefit F

Categories:
- Defined benefit plan
- Defined contribution plan
- Other long-term benefits

### Correct answers:
**Defined benefit plan:**
- Benefit A (pension based on formula with years of service and final salary)
- Benefit B (lump sum based on final salary, premiums not fixed)
- Benefit F (variable contributions, pension based on formula)

**Defined contribution plan:**
- Benefit C (5% contribution, no further obligations)
- Benefit D (3% to state plan)

**Other long-term benefits:**
- Benefit E (bonus after 15 years of service)

### Feedback: Correct

Well done. Benefits A, B, C, D, and F are post-employment benefits as they are payable after the completion of employment. Benefit E is an other long-term employee benefit as it is not wholly due within 12 months after the end of the period in which the related service took place (as the related service begins 15 years before the payment).

Post-employment benefit plans are classified as either defined contribution or defined benefit plans depending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and conditions.

## Scenario question: Defined contribution versus defined benefit

You have classified the employee benefits for Catalina. However, she would like to understand how you classified the post-employment benefit plans as either defined benefit or defined contribution plans.

Below is a list of statements that either describe the features of a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan. In order to help Catalina, choose the statements below which best describe the features of a defined benefit plan. To retrieve the benefits details that Catalina gave you, you can select Resources.

○ The plans have terms that specify how contributions, into the plan, are to be determined.

○ Actuarial risk and investment risk fall on the employees.

○ The entity's obligation is determined by the amount to be contributed into the plan for that period.

○ The entity's obligation is to provide the benefits agreed under the plan to current and former employees.

○ None of the above.

### Correct answer:
The entity's obligation is to provide the benefits agreed under the plan to current and former employees.

This is the key characteristic of a defined benefit plan - the employer bears the risk and has the obligation to provide the agreed benefits regardless of fund performance.

### Feedback: Correct

Well done! You have answered the question correctly.

Defined benefit plans indicate the amounts of post-employment benefits that an employee will receive after employment, usually as a function of factors, such as age or years of service.

Under defined benefit plans, it is the entity's obligation to provide the agreed benefits, and actuarial and investment risks fall on the entity.

## Scenario question: Accounting for Benefit C

Catalina has looked in Mark's file and found that there are no calculations for the group schemes. The incomplete details for Benefit C, the defined contribution plan, are on top of the file, so this is a good place to start. Oh dear, Catalina is still looking confused....

Select the note icon to view the notes about Benefit C and determine what expense and liability (if any) should be recognized for the employees under this plan.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Expense $40,000; Liability $0

○ Expense $45,000; Liability $0

○ Expense $40,000; Liability $5,000

○ Expense $45,000; Liability $5,000

### Benefit C Notes

**Benefit C (Group scheme)**

The employing entity is required to pay a contribution equal to 5% of salaries into a plan. Once the contributions have been paid, the entity has no further payment obligations.

• Total salaries of all employees under Benefit C in 20X1: $900,000

• Total payments into the plan in 20X1: $40,000

• There was no asset or liability for prepaid/outstanding contributions at 31 December 20X1

### Calculation:
- Required contribution: $900,000 × 5% = $45,000
- Actual payment made: $40,000
- Shortfall: $45,000 - $40,000 = $5,000

### Correct answer:
**Expense $45,000; Liability $5,000**

The expense should be the full amount due for the year ($45,000), and since only $40,000 was paid, there is an outstanding liability of $5,000.

### Feedback: Correct

Well done! You are correct.

Under a defined contribution plan, an entity's obligation is limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute to the fund. Hence, the obligation for each period is determined by the amount to be contributed for that period. The contribution for the year is equal to 5% of the salaries = $900,000 x 5% = $45,000.

An entity should recognize the contribution payable in exchange for employee service during a period:
• As a liability, after deducting any contribution paid; and
• As an expense, unless another IFRS Standard requires or permits it to be capitalized.

Therefore, the journal entries to be made in 20X1 are as follows:

Debit: **Expense $45,000**

Credit: Cash $40,000

Credit: **Liability (accrued expense) $5,000**

## Still no help from Mark

Well, you haven't done any of your own work yet, but you have successfully managed to help Catalina:

• Identify and explain how to account for short-term employee benefits;

• Distinguish between defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and other long-term employee benefits; and

• Apply the accounting treatment for defined contribution plans.

Mark's file contains minimal information on Benefit A, the defined benefit plan for senior staff members.

Catalina will probably need your further help, as she hasn't known very much about Benefit A so far. Unless you can contact Mark yourself....

The phone rings.

## Accounting for defined benefit plans

### Six-step approach

This learning topic walks through the accounting for defined benefit plans using a six-step approach.

The accounting treatment described by the steps is complex since the final benefits will depend on future events that are incorporated in the plan's benefit formula (e.g., the employee's expected life).

A funding pattern must be established which ensures that enough funds will be available to cover the benefits. Let's walk through each step in more detail.

| Step | Description |
|------|------------|
| Step 1 | Attributing benefits |
| Step 2 | Discounting the benefits |
| Step 3 | Determining the fair value of plan assets |
| Step 4 | Determining the amount of net defined benefit liability (asset) |
| Step 5 | Determining amounts recognized in profit or loss |
| Step 6 | Determine the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) to be recognized in other comprehensive income |

### Step 1: Attributing benefits

Actuarial techniques are used to make a reliable estimate of the benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods (employer's obligation). This requires an entity to attribute (allocate) benefit to periods of service and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about variables that will influence the cost of the benefit.

The image on the right reveals how an entity should attribute benefit to periods of service.

Actuarial assumptions are covered in the learning topic on "Actuarial gains and losses."

Select the image to find out more.

### Plan's benefit formula

An entity should normally attribute benefit to periods of service under the plan's benefit formula. However, if an employee's service in later years will lead to a materially higher level of benefit than in earlier years, an entity should attribute benefit on a straight-line basis from the date when service first leads to benefits under the plan, **until** the date when further service will lead to no further material benefits other than from salary increases.

Even where benefits are conditional on future employment, a constructive obligation arises. The probability that some employees might not reach the vesting criteria affects the measurement of the obligation, but not its existence (i.e., the current service cost and the present value of the obligation are adjusted to reflect the probability that certain employees may not meet the vesting criteria).

---

## Accounting for defined benefit plans (Cont.)

### Examples: Attributing benefit to periods of service

Now, let's look at examples of the circumstances in which benefit is attributed to periods of service on a straight-line basis, rather than using the plan's benefit formula.

Select each tab to find out more.

### Example 1

A post-employment medical plan reimburses 10% of an employee's post-employment medical costs if the employee leaves after more than 10 years and less than 20 years of service, and 50% of those costs if the employee leaves after 20 or more years of service.

For employees expected to leave after 20 or more years, the entity attributes benefit on a straight-line basis. Service beyond 20 years will lead to no material amount of further benefits. The benefit attributed to each of the first 20 years is 2.5% of the present value of the expected medical costs (50% divided by 20). For employees expected to leave between 10 and 20 years, the benefit attributed to each of the first 10 years is 1% of the present value of the expected medical costs. No benefit is attributed to service between the end of the 10th year and the estimated leaving date. For employees expected to leave within 10 years, no benefit is attributed.

### Example 2

An entity sponsors a defined benefit pension plan with the following terms:

• Employees are entitled to a retirement benefit when they reach age 62 and are still employed by the entity at that date;

• The amount is calculated as one month salary of final salary for each year of service, capped at 16 months of final salary (i.e., the maximum retirement benefit to which an employee is entitled is 16 months of final salary); and

• Their retirement benefit is calculated using only the number of consecutive years of employee service immediately before retirement age.

Each year of service between the age of 46 and the age of 62 leads to further benefits because the service rendered in each of those years reduces the amount of future service an employee will have to render before becoming entitled to the retirement benefit. Service beyond the age of 62 leads to no material amount of further benefits, regardless of the age at which the employee joins the entity.

Consequently, the entity attributes retirement benefit to each year in which an employee renders service from the age of 46 to the age of 62 (or, if employment commences on or after the age of 46, from the date the employee first renders service to the age of 62).

## Accounting for defined benefit plans (Cont.)

### Step 2 and 3

After the benefits have been estimated, the next steps deal with measurement, including the discounting of benefits and measurement of the plan assets at fair value.

Select each tab to find out more.

### Step 2: Discounting the benefits

The "Projected Unit Credit Method" is required to discount the benefits in order to determine the present value of the entity's defined benefit obligations and the related current service cost.

This actuarial valuation method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.

### Step 3: Determining the fair value of plan assets

The fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation in determining the deficit or surplus.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement provides a single framework for measuring fair value of assets. You may learn more about the principles of fair value measurement in the IFRS 13 e-learning module.

## Accounting for defined benefit plans (Cont.)

### Step 4: Determining the amount of net defined benefit liability (asset)

Net defined benefit liability (asset) is determined by deducting the fair value of any plan assets from the present value of the defined benefit obligation, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling.

An entity shall recognize the net defined benefit liability (asset) in the statement of financial position.

---

## Accounting for defined benefit plans (Cont.)

### Step 5: Determining amounts recognized in profit or loss

The amount to be recognized in profit or loss comprises three main components.

Select each tab to find out more.

### Current service cost

An entity shall attribute benefits to periods of service under the defined benefit plan's benefit formula. The projected unit credit method requires an entity to attribute benefits to the current period in order to determine current service cost.

Ordinary, the current service cost shall be determined using the assumptions at the start of the annual period. The amendments to IAS 19 issued in February 2018 require an entity to use updated actuarial assumptions to determine current service cost for the remainder of the annual reporting period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.

### Past service cost and gain or loss on settlement

An entity shall recognize a gain or loss on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment. An entity shall recognize past service cost (including both vested and unvested, together with gains and losses from curtailments) as an expense at the earlier of:

• When the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and

• When the entity recognizes related restructuring costs in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or termination benefits.

The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between:

• The present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled, as determined on the date of settlement; and

• The settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the entity in connection with the settlement.

The amendments to IAS 19 issued in February 2018 clarify that if a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the past service cost or gain or loss on settlement, would be measured and recognized in profit or loss while the effect of the asset ceiling is not considered. Changes in the effect of the asset ceiling would be recognized separately in other comprehensive income, as a result of the effect of the asset ceiling on the updated surplus.

### Net interest on net defined benefit liability (asset)

Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability (asset) that arises from the passage of time.

The amount is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate (with reference to the high quality corporate bonds yield), both as determined at the beginning of the annual reporting period, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments.

It can be viewed as comprising interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit obligation and interest on the effect of the asset ceiling.

The amendments to IAS 19 issued in February 2018 clarify that when a significant event, such as a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs; the net interest for the period following the significant event should be determined using the assumptions used in remeasuring the net defined benefit liability (asset).

## Accounting for defined benefit plans (Cont.)

### Step 6: Determine the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) to be recognized in other comprehensive income

The last step deals with the recognition requirements in other comprehensive income.

The amount to be recognized in other comprehensive income comprises three main components:

Select each tab to find out more about these components.

### Actuarial gains and losses

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.

### Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)

Being the actual return on plan assets net of the interest on plan assets included in the net interest component.

### Any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)

Remeasurements are never reclassified to profit or loss in a subsequent period but may be transferred within equity (e.g., to retained earnings).

The effect of asset ceiling arising under defined benefit plans is outside the scope of this module.

## Review question: Calculation of defined benefit liability

Now, test your knowledge by choosing the correct balances and using them to calculate the value for the defined benefit liability at 31 December 20X1 under a defined benefit plan.

### Balances
• Present value of the defined benefit obligation: $1,000 at 31 December 20X0 and $860 at 31 December 20X1
• Fair value of the plan assets: $1,100 at 31 December 20X0 and $1,305 at 31 December 20X1
• Current service cost: $60 during 20X1
• Net interest on the defined benefit liability (asset) during 20X1: $(5)
• Actuarial gains incurred during 20X1: $250
• Net return on plan assets during 20X1: $150 (assume no material change in the effect of the asset ceiling and the amount has been taking into account the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset))

Select and drag the best responses from the suggestions below into the blanks, and then click Submit.

• The net defined benefit asset recognized in the statement of financial position is **Answer 1**.
• The amount to be recognized in profit or loss is **Answer 2**.
• The amount to be recognized in other comprehensive income is **Answer 3**.

### Answer options:
- $55
- $65
- $100
- $250
- $400
- $445

### Correct answers:
1. **$445** (Net defined benefit asset = Fair value of plan assets $1,305 - Present value of defined benefit obligation $860 = $445)
2. **$55** (Profit or loss = Current service cost $60 - Net interest income $5 = $55)
3. **$400** (OCI = Actuarial gains $250 + Return on plan assets $150 = $400)

---

## Correct

Well done!

• The net defined benefit asset recognized in the statement of financial position is **$445** (fair value of the plan asset of $1,305 less present value of the defined benefit obligation of $860, at 31 December 20X1).

• The amount to be recognized in profit or loss is **$55** (current service cost of $60 less net interest on the defined benefit liability (asset) of $5, during 20X1).

• The amount to be recognized in other comprehensive income is **$400** (actuarial gains incurred of $250 add net return on plan assets of $150, during 20X1).

Select Continue to proceed.

---

## Contributions and benefits paid

### Contributions paid into the plan and benefits paid out

Contributions paid by an entity into a plan increase the fair value of the plan assets. Contributions have no impact on the obligation as the effects of transactions are recognized when the employee provides the service (and not when cash or its equivalent is paid).

For example, if an entity makes annual cash contributions of $10,000 into a defined benefit plan, the following journal entry is recorded:

Debit: Plan assets $10,000
Credit: Cash $10,000

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

---

## Contributions and benefits paid (Cont.)

### Benefits paid to employees

A payment of benefits is made out of plan assets in settlement of part of the entity's obligation to pay such benefits. The effects of the transactions are recognized at the time cash or its equivalent is paid.

For example, if an entity makes benefit payments of $12,000 out of a defined benefit plan, the following journal entry is recorded:

Debit: Defined benefit obligation $12,000
Credit: Cash $12,000

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

---

## Current service cost

### Measurement and recognition of current service cost

Current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period. It is the expected cost of providing the benefits that are allocated to that period.

---

## Current service cost (Cont.)

### Review question: Journal entry to recognize current service cost

An entity calculates current cost to be $5,000 in 20X1. What journal entry should be made to recognize this?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

- Debit: Defined benefit expense/income    $5,000
  Credit: Plan assets                      $5,000

- Debit: Defined benefit expense/income    $5,000
  Credit: Defined benefit obligation       $5,000

- Debit: Defined benefit expense/income    $5,000
  Credit: Cash                             $5,000

- Debit: Other comprehensive income        $5,000
  Credit: Defined benefit obligation       $5,000

### Correct answer:
**Debit: Defined benefit expense/income $5,000**
**Credit: Defined benefit obligation $5,000**

### Correct

Well done! You are correct.

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

You should now be able to apply the requirements for the current service cost.

Select Continue to proceed.

---

## Net interest on net defined benefit liability (asset)

### Net interest calculation

Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability (asset) that arises from the passage of time.

Under a defined benefit plan, the net interest cost for a period needs to be computed.

The amount is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both determined at the beginning of the annual reporting period, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments.

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position if we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts.

The buttons below reveal more information about the discount rate.

Select each button to find out more.

### How is the discount rate determined?

The rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations (both funded and unfunded) shall be determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period.

For currencies for which there is no deep market in such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields (at the end of the reporting period) on government bonds denominated in that currency shall be used.

The currency and term of the corporate bonds or government bonds shall be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

### What does the discount rate reflect?

The discount rate reflects the:

• Time value of money, but not the actuarial or investment risk; and

• Estimated timing of benefit payments.

In practice, entities often apply a single weighted average discount rate to reflect the estimated timing, amount and the currency of the benefit payments.

---

## Return on plan assets

### Measurement and recognition

The return on plan assets comprises:

• Interest, dividends, and other revenue derived from the plan assets together with realized and unrealized gains or losses on the plan assets; and

• Less any cost of managing the plan assets and any tax payable by the plan itself, other than tax included in the actuarial assumptions used to measure the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

---

## Actuarial gains and losses

### Actuarial assumptions and actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses result from increases or decreases in the present value of the defined benefit obligation because of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments.

All actuarial gains and losses are to be recognized immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net pension asset or liability recognized in the statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the plan deficit or surplus.

The questions below reveal more information.

Select each tab to find out more.

### What are actuarial assumptions?

Actuarial assumptions are an entity's best estimate of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits. They comprise:

• Demographic assumptions (about the future characteristics of current and former employees and their dependents who are eligible for benefits); and

• Financial assumptions.

### What are some examples of actuarial assumptions?

Demographic assumptions deal with matters such as mortality, rates of employee turnover, disability, and claim rates under medical plans.

Financial assumptions deal with matters such as the discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, future medical costs, and taxes payable by the plan relating the benefits.

### What are some causes of actuarial gains and losses?

Causes of actuarial gains and losses include, for example:

• Unexpected high or low rates of employee turnover, early retirement or mortality or of increases in salaries, benefits (if the formal or constructive terms of a plan provide for inflationary benefit increases) or medical costs;

• The effect of changes to assumptions concerning benefit payment options;

• The effect of changes in estimates of future employee turnover, early retirement or mortality or increases in salaries, benefits (if the formal or constructive terms of a plan provide for inflationary benefit increases) or medical costs; and

• The effect of changes in the discount rate.

---

## Actuarial gains and losses (Cont.)

### Review question: Sources of actuarial gains and losses
Which of the following result in actuarial gains and losses?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

- A decrease in the present value of the obligation due to a difference between the actual rate of employee turnover and the expected rate

- An increase in the present value of the obligation due to the interest cost on the defined obligation for the year

- An increase in the fair value of plan assets due to contributions paid during the year

- None of the above

### Correct answer:
**A decrease in the present value of the obligation due to a difference between the actual rate of employee turnover and the expected rate**

### Correct

Well done! You have answered the question correctly.

Actuarial gains and losses result from increases or decreases in the present value of a defined benefit obligation. They arise because actual outcomes or current forecasts differ from the forecasts of earlier periods (expected values).

Select Continue to proceed.

## Actuarial gains and losses (Cont.)

### Calculating actuarial gains and losses

Actuarial gains and losses arise from actual movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. The diagram summarizes the change in the present value of the obligation. It's often used to calculate actuarial gains and losses. They are the balancing figures in the diagram.

The necessary journal entries for each component shown in the diagram are explained in other learning topics.

Select the image to find out more.

| Present value of obligation |  |
|---|---|
| Brought forward @ start of period | (X) |
| Net interest cost | (X) |
| Benefits paid | X |
| Current service cost | (X) |
| Actuarial gain (loss) | X |
| Carried forward @ end of period | (X) |

Total actuarial gains (losses) = actuarial gain (loss) on the present value of obligation

You should now be able to explain what actuarial gains and losses are, and calculate total actuarial gain (or loss).

## Contributions from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans

Some defined benefit plans require employees or third parties to contribute to the cost of the plan. In general, such contributions are treated as part of the post-employment benefits, which effectively reduce the cost to the entity.

IAS 19 provides specific guidance in accounting for contributions by employees or third parties, depending on whether those contributions are either set out in the formal terms of the plan (or arise from a constructive obligation that goes beyond those terms), or are discretionary. Where such contributions are non-discretionary, the accounting also differs dependent on whether they are linked to service or not.

Select each highlighted area in the diagram to find out more about the different accounting requirements.

### Contributions from employees or third parties

```

### Dependent on the number of years of service

If the amount of the contributions is dependent on the number of years of employee service, an entity shall attribute the contributions to periods of service using an attribution method for the gross benefit (i.e., either using the plan's contribution formula or on a straight-line basis).

### Independent on the number of years of service

If the amount of the contributions by employees or third parties is independent of the number of years of employee service, the entity is permitted to recognize such contributions as a reduction of the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. Examples of contributions that are independent of the number of years of service include those that are a fixed percentage of the employee's salary, a fixed amount throughout the service period or dependent on the employee's age.

### Not linked to service

If the amount of the contributions by employees or third parties is not linked to service, it affects remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset).

### Discretionary

If the amount of the contributions by employees or third parties is discretionary, it reduces service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan.

### Email

**From:** Wong, Bill <bwong@turnstylegroup.com>
**To:** user@turnstylegroup.com
**Subject:** Details regarding Benefit A

Dear Sir,

My name is Bill Wong. I'll be working in the payroll department for the next few weeks.

Catalina Anello received the email below from Mark yesterday, apparently a few minutes before he left the office to go on holiday. It contains some details about the group defined benefit scheme, Benefit A.

Mark has included some guidance for accounting for Benefit A, but I really don't understand it. Catalina suggested that I contact you as she said you were very helpful earlier this morning.

Regards,
Bill

## Mark's Email with Benefit A Details

**From:** Wong, Bill <bwong@turnstylegroup.com>
**To:** user@turnstylegroup.com
**Subject:** Details regarding Benefit A

-----Original Message-----
**From:** Beech, Mark
**To:** Anello, Catalina (UK - London)
**Subject:** FW: Details regarding Benefit A

Hi Catalina,

The details about Benefit A are in the attachment.

I suggest that the first step in your calculations is to summarize the changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets in a table (see my diagram in the attachment). These are the two main components of the net pension liability (defined benefit liability) and so they will not appear separately in the statement of financial position. However, separating the net pension liability into its components in this way will help you to understand the journal entries and calculations.

By looking at the journal entries for each component of the changes in the obligation and the assets and completing the table, you'll be able to determine the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability for the period.

All the best. I'll send a postcard. Please give me a call on my cell phone (230) 98923845 if you have any problems.

Regards,
Mark

### Attachment: Benefit A Details

**Benefit A (Group defined benefit plan for senior staff)**

Our policy is to pay 10% of an employee's gross annual remuneration into the fund. Upon retirement, employees receive a pension (part of which may be taken as a lump sum on retirement date) calculated by a formula based on years of service and final annual salary.

**Balances**
- Contributions paid to the fund (in cash) in 20X1: $180,000
- Benefits paid to the employees in 20X1: $300,000
- Current service cost in 20X1: $260,000
(For simplicity, there is no past service cost and gain or loss on settlement incurred during the year)

**Present value of obligation**
- 31 December 20X0: $3,000,000
- 31 December 20X1: $3,382,000

**Fair value of plan assets**
- 31 December 20X0: $2,100,000
- 31 December 20X1: $2,295,000

**Actuarial loss during the year**
- Actuarial loss on the defined benefit obligations arising during the year: $122,000

The average remaining working life of employees at 31 December 20X1 is 10 years.

**Accounting policy note**
Income and expenses related to post-employment benefits are not eligible for capitalization in the cost of non-current assets or inventory.

For ease of calculation, TurnStyle treats the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets, the two main components of the defined benefit liability, as separate accounts when posting the journal entries. However, only the defined benefit liability (net pension asset/liability) appears in the statement of financial position.

### Diagram

Table to summarize the changes in the present value of the obligation and the fair value of the assets:

|  | Defined benefit obligation | Plan assets |
|---|---|---|

| Changes in present value of obligation | ↕ | |
| Changes in fair value of assets | | ↕ |
| Cf | X | X |

## Mark's suggested approach

Mark suggested that the first step in the calculations should be to determine the deficit or surplus of the defined benefit plan by identifying the changes in the present value of the obligation and the fair value of the assets. In his email, Mark suggests building up a table similar to the one shown in the image, using the information in the attachment to his email.

You'll be building up the table throughout this Scenario and replacing all of the question marks with the correct values, which may be zero in some cases.

The first two balances listed are:
• Contributions paid into the fund; and
• Benefits paid to the employee.

You'll need to consider the treatment of these two items and add them to the table in place of the related question marks.

**Note:** To keep interest computations simple, all transactions are assumed to occur at the year-end (in practice, the calculations will be more complex).

### Table to complete:

|  | Present value of obligation $000 | Fair value of plan assets $000 |
|---|---|---|
| Bf @ 1 January 20X1 | (3,000) | 2,100 |
|  | ? | ? |
|  | ? | ? |
|  | ? | ? |
|  | ? | ? |
|  | ? | ? |
| Cf @ 31 December 20X1 | (3,382) | 2,295 |

## Incorrect

Sorry, that's not correct.

First, review the learning session related to "Contributions and benefits paid" by selecting Learning.

After you have reviewed the concepts, select Try Again to attempt the question again.

---

## Learning: Contributions paid into the plan and benefits paid out

Contributions paid by an entity into a plan increase the fair value of the plan assets. Contributions have no impact on the obligation as the effects of transactions are recognized when the employee provides the service (and not when cash or its equivalent is paid).

For example, if an entity makes annual cash contributions of $10,000 into a defined benefit plan, the following journal entry is recorded:

Debit: Plan assets $10,000
Credit: Cash $10,000

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

---

## Correct Answer

The correct answer is:

### Table completed:

|  | Present value of obligation $000 | Fair value of plan assets $000 | Net defined benefit asset (liability) $000 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bf @ 1 January 20X1 | (3,000) | 2,100 | 900 |
| Net Interest cost | ? | ? | ? |
| Contributions paid | 0 | 180 | ? |
| Benefits paid | 300 | (300) | ? |
| Current service cost | ? | ? | ? |
| Remeasurements | 122 | ? | ? |
| Cf @ 31 December 20X1 | (3,382) | 2,295 | ? |

The cash contributions into the defined benefit plan will lead to an increase in the plan assets and decrease in the cash. In fact, the journal entry for the cash contributions into the defined benefit plan is:

Debit: Plan assets **$180,000**
Credit: Cash **$180,000**

The payment of benefits is made out of plan assets and is in settlement of part of the entity's obligation to pay such benefits. The journal entry is therefore:

Debit: Defined benefit obligation **$300,000**
Credit: Plan assets **$300,000**

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

## Day dreaming

You've just sent your response to Bill and want to get a cup of coffee. But a voice is calling your name. There is an unfamiliar looking man standing at your desk. He introduces himself as Bill Wong, from the Payroll Department.

Select each image in turn to view the conversation.

### Bill's conversation:

**Bill:** "Thanks for all your help. However, I have a few other questions about accounting for the defined benefit plan. Can you help me? Catalina said you have a better understanding than her."

**Bill:** "I'm unsure how to calculate the amount recognized in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. I am not very familiar with the Standard."

**Bill:** "I tried to identify the treatment from the accounting policy note in Mark's email, but I don't know what to do with the information. I'd appreciate if you can help me out with this."

## Scenario question: Determine the net defined benefit asset/liability

You explain to Bill how to determine the net defined benefit asset/liability. Using the details about Benefit A in Mark's email (accessible in Resources), choose the correct values to determine the net defined benefit asset/liability to be shown in the statement of financial position at 31 December 20X1.

Select and drag the best responses from the suggestions below into the blanks, and then click Submit.

Components:

• Present value of the defined benefit obligation: **Answer 1**

• Fair value of the plan assets: **Answer 2**

Net defined benefit **Answer 3** at 31 December 20X1: **Answer 4**

### Answer options:
- $900,000
- $1,087,000
- $2,160,000
- $2,295,000
- $3,000,000
- $3,382,000
- asset
- liability

### Correct answers:
1. Present value of the defined benefit obligation: **$3,382,000**
2. Fair value of the plan assets: **$2,295,000**
3. Net defined benefit: **liability**
4. Amount at 31 December 20X1: **$1,087,000**

(Calculation: $3,382,000 - $2,295,000 = $1,087,000 liability)

---

## Correct

Well done! You are correct.

Net defined benefit **liability** at 31 December 20X1 is **$1,087,000**, determined by:

• Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 20X1: **$3,382,000**

• **Less** the fair value of the plan assets at 31 December 20X1: **$2,295,000**.

Select Continue to proceed.

### Correct answer:
**Debit: Defined benefit expense/income $260,000**
**Credit: Defined benefit obligation $260,000**

---

## Correct

Well done! You have answered the question correctly.

The current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period. The following double entry is recorded:

Debit: Defined benefit expense/income $260,000
Credit: Defined benefit obligation $260,000

**Note:** For the purpose of understanding the IAS 19 journal entries, we are treating the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets as separate accounts. However, they will not be presented separately in the statement of financial position.

## An unexpected email

So far, you've used Mark's suggested approach to show how the following components affect the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets:

• Contributions paid into the plan;

• Benefits paid; and

• Current service cost.

You've also helped Bill to determine the net defined benefit liability as at 31 December 20X1, and the current service cost.

Select the Excel icon to download and view your calculation.

Just then, you receive a Skype message from Catalina. She has just received an unexpected email from Mark. She forwards it to you.

Select the email icon to read Mark's message.

### Mark's email

Hi Catalina,

I finally managed to get the RightFax at the hotel working.

I wrote the flight details down on the back of the page with the assumptions and actual values for Benefit A and walked off with it. You're likely to need this information to calculate the interest cost and return on plan assets.

Regards,
Mark

### Additional information from Mark

• Discount rate with reference to high quality corporate bond yield for 20X1: 10%.

• Actual rate of return on plan assets for 20X1: 5% (for simplicity, the rate has been taking into account the net interest on the net defined benefit liability).

## Scenario question: Net interest on the net defined benefit liability

Excellent! The information in Mark's RightFax document will enable you to calculate the net interest on the net defined benefit liability. To retrieve the attachment contained in Mark's email, you can select Resources.

Note: To keep calculations simple, assume that all transactions occur at the end of the year (i.e., there are no changes to the value of the plan assets and the obligation during the year as a result of contribution and benefit payments).

Choose the correct value for the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the year.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ $90,000

○ $210,000

○ $300,000

○ None of the above

### Correct answer:
**$90,000**

### Calculation:
Net interest on net defined benefit liability = Net defined benefit liability at start of year × Discount rate
= $900,000 × 10% = $90,000

(Where net defined benefit liability at 1 January 20X1 = Present value of obligation $3,000,000 - Fair value of plan assets $2,100,000 = $900,000)

### Feedback: Correct

Well done!

Net interest on the net defined benefit liability = discount rate (with reference to high quality corporate bond yield) × net defined benefit liability at the start of the year = 10% × $900,000 = $90,000.

Select Continue to proceed.

## Scenario question: Calculate the net defined benefit expense

Now, you should have enough information to determine the net defined benefit expense to be recognized in profit or loss. Using the details about Benefit A from Mark's email, choose the correct value from the options below.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ $160,000

○ $193,000

○ $208,000

○ $223,000

○ $245,000

○ $350,000

### Correct answer:
**$350,000**

### Calculation:
Net defined benefit expense recognized in profit or loss consists of:
- Current service cost: $260,000
- Net interest on net defined benefit liability: $90,000
- Total expense in profit or loss: $260,000 + $90,000 = $350,000

(Note: Remeasurements, including actuarial gains/losses and the return on plan assets excluding net interest, are recognized in other comprehensive income, not in profit or loss)

### Feedback: Correct

Well done!

You will need to explain to Bill that the net defined benefit expense for 20X1 is $350,000, comprised of:

• Current service cost $260,000; and

• Net interest cost on net defined benefit liability $90,000.

Select Continue to proceed.

## Busy line...

With the help of Mark's RightFax document, your calculation on amounts recognized in the statement of financial position and profit or loss is nearly complete.

As you prepare to look at the final calculation on remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, Catalina walks over and tells you that she tried to send an email back to Mark using the reply function, but surprisingly enough, the email bounced back....

---

## Scenario question: Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability

Catalina and Bill are both suspicious—after all this effort, it looks like Mark's deliberately avoiding being contacted! Anyway, you'll have to carry on by yourself.

The next step is to determine the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability to be recognized in the other comprehensive income. Using the information about Benefit A, which is detailed in the attachment to Mark's email which Bill sent to you before lunch, choose the correct value.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ $15,000 gain

○ $16,000 gain

○ $17,000 loss

○ $108,000 gain

○ $130,000 gain

○ $170,000 loss

### Correct answer:
**$17,000 loss**

### Calculation:
Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income consist of:
- Actuarial loss on defined benefit obligation: $(122,000)
- Return on plan assets (excluding amounts in net interest): $105,000
- Total remeasurement loss: $(122,000) + $105,000 = $(17,000)

The return on plan assets excluding net interest is calculated as:
- Actual return on plan assets (change in fair value adjusted for contributions and benefits): $315,000
- Less: Interest income on plan assets included in net interest ($2,100,000 × 10%): $(210,000)
- Return on plan assets excluding net interest: $105,000

Therefore, the total remeasurement is a loss of $17,000 to be recognized in other comprehensive income.

### Feedback: Correct

Well done!

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial losses on the defined benefit obligations of $122,000 less net return on plan assets of $105,000 (5% × $2,100,000).

The net amount of $17,000 is recognized in other comprehensive income. Note that the expected return on plan assets is no longer recognized.

## Summary

Well done! After your conversation with Bill about your calculations, he was really impressed with your in-depth knowledge and detailed explanations. As you return to your desk, you see a Post-it note from Asha on your computer screen. Asha seems to have assumed that you've adopted Mark's job as well as your own. Well, you're learning his job quickly.

Now, you can:

• Outline the accounting for defined benefit plans;

• Determine the deficit or surplus of a defined benefit plan;

• Identify the components of the net defined benefit liability;

• Apply the measurement and recognition requirements for the contributions into the plan, benefits paid, current service cost, net interest on the net defined benefit liability; and

• Identify the components of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability.

You set off towards Asha's office. When you get back you think perhaps you could do with a change of scene. You might as well check your current annual leave entitlement—to make sure you have enough for an exotic holiday....

### Post-it note from Asha

Hi, I mentioned this morning that I had a query about staff bonuses. Can you come and see me in my office?

Thanks,
Asha

That completes Scenario 2. You can now go back to Menu to start the next scenario.

# Scenario 3: Sales bonuses and termination benefits

## Learning objectives

In this session, you will learn about the key requirements for other long-term employee benefits and termination benefits.

After completing this session, you will be able to:

• Describe and apply the accounting treatment for other long-term employee benefits; and

• Identify termination benefits and describe the accounting treatment for termination benefits.

---

## Asha's office

Asha waves you into her office.

Asha: "Thanks for coming to see me. As I may have mentioned, I have a query relating to sales staff bonuses and the impact it'll have on profit for the coming year. I asked Catalina about it yesterday, but she couldn't help, apparently Mark was looking at it.

I've been trying to get hold of him on his phone, but he couldn't hear me and I could hardly hear him—I think he was on a beach somewhere...."

## Other long-term employee benefits

### Recognition and measurement

Accounting for other long-term employee benefits differs from the treatment for post-employment benefits as follows:

• Measurement involves less uncertainty; and

• Remeasurements are not recognized in other comprehensive income.

Select each tab to see how to determine the liability and the income/expense to be recognized for other long-term employee benefits.

### Statement of financial position

The liability recognized in the statement of financial position is the net total of:

• The present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date (i.e., the gross obligation before deducting the fair value of plan assets)

• Less the fair value at the reporting date of any plan assets.

If it is virtually certain that another party will reimburse some or all the expenditures required to settle a defined benefit obligation, an entity shall recognize its right to reimbursement as a separate asset, measured at fair value.

### Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income

The income or expense recognized in profit or loss is the net total of:

• Service cost;

• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset); and

• Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset).

---

## Other long-term employee benefits (Cont.)

### Example: Amount recognized in profit or loss

Watson Co. gives employees a bonus equal to $1,500 after 15 years of service. Therefore, a benefit of $100 (= $1,500/15) is attributed to each year and the annual current service cost is the present value of $100. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is the present value of $100, multiplied by the number of years of service up to the reporting date.

On 1 January 20X6, Watson improves the amount to $3,000 for employees who have been with the entity since 1 January 20X1. The present value at 1 January 20X6 of the additional benefits (i.e., the change in the obligation) for service from 1 January 20X1 to 1 January 20X6 is shown in the image.

Select the image to find out the amount that should be recognized for the added benefit in profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 20X6.

### Present value at 1 January 20X1 of the additional benefits for service from 1 January 20X1 to 1 January 20X6:

|  | $ |
|---|---|
| Employees with over 15 years' service at 1 January 20X6 | 18,000 |
| Employees with less than 15 years' service at 1 January 20X6 (average period until benefits become vested: Eight years) | 14,000 |
|  | 32,000 |

### Amount to be recognized

All past service cost relating to other long-term employee benefits is recognized in profit or loss immediately.

In 20X6, Watson Co. recognizes:

• $18,000 because those benefits are already vested; and

• $14,000 as a past service cost.

The full cost of $32,000 is expensed immediately.

## Termination benefits

### What are termination benefits?

Select each tab to find out more.

### Definition

Termination benefits are employee benefits payable as a result of either an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date, or an employee's decision to accept voluntary redundancy in exchange for those benefits.

### Form

The form of the employee benefit does not determine whether it is provided in exchange for service or in exchange for termination of the employee's employment. Termination benefits are typically lump sum payments, but sometimes also include:

• Enhancement of post-employee benefits, either indirectly through an employee benefit plan or directly; and/or

• Salary until the end of a specified notice period if the employee renders no further service.

---

## Termination benefits (Cont.)

### Review question: Identifying termination benefits

Which of the following employee benefits should be classified as termination benefits?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Payment of benefits that are payable regardless of the reason for departure

○ A lump sum payment to employees who accept voluntary termination

○ Payment of normal retirement benefits to past employees

○ None of the above

### Correct answer:
**A lump sum payment to employees who accept voluntary termination**

This is a termination benefit because it is specifically payable as a result of the employee's decision to accept voluntary redundancy in exchange for the benefit.

Benefits payable regardless of the reason for departure are not termination benefits (they would be post-employment benefits), and normal retirement benefits to past employees are post-employment benefits, not termination benefits.

### Feedback: Correct

Well done! You have answered the question correctly.

Termination benefits are employee benefits payable as a result of either an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date, or an employee's decision to accept voluntary redundancy in exchange for those benefits.

Termination benefits are typically lump sum payments, but sometimes include:

• Enhancement of post-employment benefits, either indirectly through an employee benefit plan or directly, and/or
• Salary until the end of a specified notice period if the employee renders no further service to the entity.

Select Continue to proceed.

## Termination benefits (Cont.)

### Accounting treatment

IAS 19 deals with termination benefits separately from other employee benefits because an obligation arises from the termination rather than from employee service. As termination benefits do not provide an entity with future economic benefits, they are recognized immediately. A liability and an expense shall be recognized for termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

• When the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

• When the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

The IAS 19 approach for termination benefits is consistent with that for restructuring provisions in IAS 37.

Select the image to see what it means when an entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.

### Guidance on termination benefits

For termination benefits payable as a result of an employee's decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment, the time when an entity can no longer withdraw the offer of termination benefits is the earlier of:

• When the employee accepts the offer; and

• When a restriction (e.g., a legal regulator or contractual requirement or other restriction) on the entity's ability to withdraw the offer takes effect. This would be when the offer is made, if the restriction existed at the time of the offer.

For termination benefits payable as a result of an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment, the entity can no longer withdraw the offer when the entity has communicated to the affected employees a plan of termination meeting all of the following criteria:

• Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made;

• The plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to be terminated, their job classifications or functions, and their locations; and

• The plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will receive in sufficient details that employees can determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is terminated.

## The conversation at Asha's office

You are in the Asha's office.

She wanted to ask Mark about the sales staff bonuses and its impact on profit for the coming year, but there's no hope to catch up with Mark.

Asha: "Anyway, it's a slightly sensitive matter, so please keep this to yourself for now...."

That's an important message and you don't want to miss it.

Select the REC icon to hear the sensitive matter.

### Subject: Impact of sales bonuses

"I've heard that there's been some temporary unrest in the Sales Department, and I feel it's important to keep the more experienced members of sales staff—I want to offer some sort of incentive.

In our Sales Department, there are 10 people—we have three very high caliber staff (one has worked here for nine years and two for eight years in 20X1). So, I'm thinking of rewarding sales staff based on length of service rather than through a salary increase over the next two years. I'm planning to pay a long-service payment of $5,000 per person for 10 years of service (i.e., a 10-year jubilee).

I have calculated additional payments that we will need to make for an extra 2% salary increase over inflation and they are $7,400 in 20X2 and $7,600 in 20X3.

Alternatively, I would need to make one jubilee payment next year and two payments in the year after that for the three experienced sales staff I mentioned. All other members of the sales team have been with us for less than five years.

I know that the 2% pay raise will affect profit in the same period as it is paid. I assume this is the same for the jubilee payment. Therefore, the impact on profit will be:

• $5,000 in 20X2; and
• $10,000 in 20X3.

Are my assumptions right?

Profits in 20X2 are budgeted to be higher than 20X1, so, from this perspective, a jubilee payment also makes more sense."

---

## The effect of the long service payment

### Are Asha's assumptions correct?

As Asha is occupied on the phone, you decide to look through Mark's payroll file. As Mark appears to run the Payroll Department, not Catalina, it would be useful to read his document to ensure you have considered all the major points.

---

## Mark's solution

Bingo! At the bottom of the file, you find some notes detailing the jubilee payment.

Here are the extracts from Mark's document:

The jubilee payment is classified as an "other long-term employee benefit" under IAS 19.

A benefit of $500 should be attributed to each of the 10 qualifying years (= $5,000/10). The current service cost is the present value of $500.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is the present value of $500, multiplied by the number of years of service (≤ 10 years) up to the reporting date.

The liability recognized in the statement of financial position is the net total of the present value of this defined benefit obligation less the fair value of any plan assets.

As the benefit has been introduced midway through the 10-year service period of the employees, an adjustment needs to be made to recognize the obligation for the portion of the benefits already earned through employee service performed in prior periods. Therefore, a past service cost arises which is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods.

Under IAS 19, all past service cost relating to other long-term employee benefits is recognized in profit or loss immediately.

Therefore, the charge in 20X2 will be the past service cost for service before 20X2 and the 20X2 charge. This will need to provide for the following benefits already earned by employees:

• $5,000 for the employee reaching 10 years in 20X2;
• $9,000 (= $500 × 9 × 2) for the two employees reaching nine years in 20X2; and
• $500 per year of service for each of the remaining seven employees.

In 20X3, the charge will be $500 for all staff members with less than 10 years of service, $4,500 (= $500 × 9).

## Asha's reaction

As you finish reading Mark's notes, Asha puts the phone down and apologizes for your wait. After giving her your advice on the jubilee payment, she seems surprised.

Select each image in turn to view the conversation.

### Conversation 1
Oh! I wasn't expecting such a large impact in 20X2 ... I'll have to consider the payment more carefully ... Oh, yes, and there was another thing. We're offering termination payments for voluntary redundancies, and we've made this public. Will these expenses impact on the 20X1 financial statements?

### Conversation 2
I understand IAS 19 states that an entity shall recognize a liability and expense for termination benefits at the earlier of the dates when it can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and when it recognizes costs for a restructuring under IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

### Conversation 3
The thing is, I'm not sure if we met the criterion before the year-end. Here's the memo about it that was sent out last month, just before Christmas.

Select the document icon to read the memo.

### Staff Memo

**To:** All Staff
**From:** Human Resources
**Date:** 9 December 20X1
**Re:** Voluntary redundancies

Dear Colleague,

Over the last few months, TurnStyle Group has been looking at various cost-cutting measures forced on us by a significant downturn in revenues from many of our fashion lines. Many redundancies have been made elsewhere in the fashion industry and no one can be sure how long we will be facing this downturn.

It is appropriate that I should inform you of the facts about the situation currently facing TurnStyle Group.

We have always emphasised that TurnStyle will go to extreme lengths to save money before job cuts are contemplated. However, the savings made to date do not come close to the shortfall in fashion revenues.

The company accepts that a revised profit target is necessary. Therefore, we are all being asked to make sacrifices. Accordingly, the company has taken the difficult decision to terminate certain employees' contracts by the end of the year. The main points concerning staff terminations from our detailed cost saving plan are summarized below.

Fifteen head office redundancies are planned at the end of next month. Similar redundancies are planned at our subsidiaries. The head office redundancies will be allocated to departments as shown below:

• Sales 5
• Production 5
• IT 1
• Research 1
• Accounts/Payroll 1
• Human Resources/Admin 2

The termination benefits for each proposed position have been fully costed based on average salaries and average lengths of service in each of the departments.

Initially, as many job losses as possible will be made from voluntary redundancy or early retirement, although not all volunteers may be suitable or come from the right areas.

Let me reassure you that apart from the measures detailed here, NO further measures are being considered.

Asha Jadhav
CEO, TurnStyle Group

## Scenario question: Meeting the recognition criteria?

In order to help Asha conclude whether a liability and expense for the termination should be recognized in 20X1, you'll need to determine whether the group met all three criteria at the year-end and therefore, whether TurnStyle should recognize the termination benefits.

At 31 December 20X1, has TurnStyle communicated to the affected employees a plan of termination meeting the following criteria:

To retrieve the staff memo that Asha showed you, you can select Resources.

Select and drag each option into the best column, and then click Submit.

| Options to classify | Meeting the criteria | Not meeting the criteria |
|---|---|---|
| The plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will receive in sufficient detail that employees can determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is terminated. |  |  |
| The plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations (but the plan need not identify each individual employee), and the expected completion date. |  |  |
| Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made. |  |  |

### Correct classification:
**Meeting the criteria:**
- The plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will receive in sufficient detail that employees can determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is terminated.
- The plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations (but the plan need not identify each individual employee), and the expected completion date.
- Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made.

All three criteria are met based on the December 9, 20X1 memo which detailed the number of redundancies, departments affected, and stated that benefits were fully costed and no further measures were being considered.

### Correct

Well done! You selected the correct responses.

An entity should recognize termination benefits as a liability and an expense when it can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.

The memo indicates that TurnStyle has communicated to the affected employees a plan of termination meeting the following criteria specified in IAS 19:

• The plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations (but the plan need not identify each individual employee) and the expected completion date;
• The plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will receive in sufficient details that employees can determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is terminated; and
• Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made.

The termination benefits will be recognized in 20X1 as TurnStyle can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits at 31 December 20X1. The expense/liability will be calculated based on the expected number of redundancies and the expected additional benefits payable per position due to the termination.

## Some surprising news

Asha isn't surprised at your conclusions as she assumed that would be the case, as the termination plan was settled early in December. She thanks you and leaves for a meeting. Finally, you have time for your first cup of coffee of the afternoon, a bit later than usual. As you walk to the coffee machine, you overhear Bob talking to Marie from the accounts department.

Select each image in turn to view the conversation.

### Conversation 1
Bob: "Hey Marie, have you heard? Mark has put his name down for voluntary redundancy! You'll never guess why!"

### Conversation 2
Bob: "He has met his wife in Mauritius! He has fallen so head-over-heels in love that he has decided not to come back!"

Marie: "You're joking!"

### Conversation 3
Well ... you're as shocked as Marie! If this is true, it means you'll definitely be spending more time helping out in the Payroll Department. Perhaps you should try to call Mark again to see if the news is true.

## The end of the day

You haven't found out if the news is true or not, but it does sound like there's a party going on where Mark is. Unfortunately, you may need to assist the Payroll Department for some time now.

Well, you're the best person for the job. You now know a great deal about employee benefits! You've been able to help Asha to:

• Describe and apply the accounting treatment for other long-term benefits; and

• Identify termination benefits and outline the accounting treatment for them.

Now, where were you? Ah yes, day dreaming about your tropical holidays ... and maybe even a touch of holiday romance?

That completes Scenario 3. You can now go back to Menu and get ready for the assessment.

# Final Assessment

## Question 01 of 16

First, select the Document icon to read the details about Lantau Group's annual leave.

### IAS 19e: Lantau_group

#### Lantau Group's annual leave details

**Lantau Group's annual leave**

• Financial year end: 31 December 20X1
• Total employees: 50
• Average unused entitlement of annual leave at 31 December 20X0: 2 days per employee
• Average amount of annual leave taken during 20X1: 14 days per employee

**Accounting policy for annual leave**

In addition to all general holidays, employees will be allowed 15 days of paid annual leave each year. Annual leave cannot be accrued. Any outstanding balance will be forfeited on 31 December each year.

### Question

Based on the details in the document, how many days of paid leave should Lantau Group recognize as a liability for at 31 December 20X1?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ 50 days
○ 200 days
○ 150 days
○ 0 days ✓
○ 100 days

**Correct Answer: 0 days**

**Explanation:** Since Lantau Group's annual leave policy states that "Annual leave cannot be accrued" and "Any outstanding balance will be forfeited on 31 December each year", this represents non-accumulating compensated absences. According to IAS 19, non-accumulating compensated absences are recognized only when the absences occur, not as a liability in advance. Therefore, no liability should be recognized at 31 December 20X1.

---

## Question 02 of 16

For each of the following employee benefits, identify which one should be clearly classified as other long-term benefits under IAS 19.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Deferred compensation payable 20 months after the period in which it is earned ✓
○ Paid sick leave
○ Medical care
○ Paid maternity leave
○ Lump sum retirement benefit of $5,000 that vests after five years of service

**Correct Answer: Deferred compensation payable 20 months after the period in which it is earned**

**Explanation:** According to IAS 19, other long-term employee benefits are all employee benefits other than short-term employee benefits, post-employment benefits, and termination benefits. The deferred compensation payable 20 months after the period is clearly an other long-term benefit because:
- It's not short-term (exceeds 12 months after the reporting period)
- It's not post-employment (paid while still employed)
- It's not a termination benefit

The other options are:
- Paid sick leave and paid maternity leave: Typically short-term benefits
- Medical care: Could be short-term if current, or post-employment if for retirees
- Lump sum retirement benefit: This is a post-employment benefit (defined benefit plan)

---

## Question 03 of 16

Select the Document icon to read descriptions of four different post-employment benefit plans.

Which of the plans should be classified as defined benefit plans?

### IAS 19e: Four_plans

#### Four post-employment benefit plans

Plan 1: The beneficiary is promised a particular level of retirement benefit by the entity or by a pension fund. The premiums payable by the entity are not fixed in advance.

Plan 2: Contributions are fixed in advance, are paid to pension funds and the beneficiary's right to benefits exists against the pension funds. The employer has no obligation beyond payment of the contributions.

Plan 3: Contributions are paid by the entity and the employees. The employee contributions are calculated as a percentage of annual salary, depending on age, and they vary between 8% and 12%. The entity contributions are variable and amount from 125% to 250% of the employee contributions depending on the financial situation of the pension fund. The pension plan formula is based on years of contributions and final salary.

Plan 4: In their contract, employees are entitled to receive a lump sum benefit payable on termination of service and equal to 0.5% of final salary for each year of service. An employer pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of annual salary to a plan towards funding its employee benefit obligations.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Plans 1 and 2
○ Plans 1, 2, and 4
○ Plans 1 and 4
○ Plans 1, 2, and 3
○ Plans 1 and 3
○ Plans 1, 3, and 4 ✓

**Correct Answer: Plans 1, 3, and 4**

**Explanation:** 
- **Plan 1** is a defined benefit plan because the entity promises a particular level of retirement benefit and premiums are not fixed (entity bears the risk).
- **Plan 2** is a defined contribution plan because contributions are fixed in advance and the employer has no obligation beyond payment of contributions.
- **Plan 3** is a defined benefit plan because the entity's contributions are variable (125% to 250% of employee contributions) depending on the pension fund's financial situation, and the benefits are based on final salary. The entity bears actuarial and investment risk.
- **Plan 4** is a defined benefit plan because employees are entitled to a specific benefit formula (0.5% of final salary per year of service). Even though the employer makes regular contributions, the obligation is to provide the promised benefit amount.

---

## Question 04 of 16

The statements below either describe the features of defined contribution plans or they describe the features of defined benefit plans.

Which statement best describes defined contribution plans?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Actuarial risk and investment risk fall on the entity.
○ The plans have terms that specify how contributions into the plan are to be determined. ✓
○ The plans have terms that specify the amount of post-employment benefits the employees are to receive.
○ The entity's obligation is to provide the benefits agreed under the plan to current and former employees.

**Correct Answer: The plans have terms that specify how contributions into the plan are to be determined.**

**Explanation:** This is the key characteristic of defined contribution plans. Under defined contribution plans:
- The entity's obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute (not to provide specific benefits)
- The plans specify how contributions are determined (e.g., 5% of salary), not the benefits to be received
- Actuarial risk and investment risk fall on the employee, not the entity
- The amount of post-employment benefits depends on contributions paid plus investment returns

The other options describe defined benefit plans where the entity bears the risks and must provide agreed benefits.

## Question 05 of 16

Access the information provided by selecting the Document icon, and then calculate the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the year.

Note: To keep calculations simple, assume that all transactions occur at the end of the year (i.e., there are no material changes to the value of the plan assets and the obligation during the year as a result of contribution and benefit payments).

### Document Information:

Present value of defined benefit obligation
• At 31 December 20X0: $1,200,000
• At 31 December 20X1: $1,300,000

Fair value of plan assets
• At 31 December 20X0: $1,190,000
• At 31 December 20X1: $1,210,000

Current service cost: $170,000
Benefits paid by plan: $320,000
Discount rate with reference to high quality corporate bond yield for 20X1: 10%

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ $1,000: ($1,200,000 – $1,190,000) × 10%
○ $9,000: ($1,300,000 – $1,210,000) × 10%
○ $10,000: ($1,300,000 – $1,200,000) × 10%
○ $11,000: ($1,300,000 – $1,190,000) × 10%
○ $12,000: $1,200,000 × 10%

**Correct Answer: $1,000: ($1,200,000 – $1,190,000) × 10%** ✓

**Explanation:** Net interest is calculated on the net defined benefit liability (or asset) at the beginning of the period using the discount rate. 

At 31 December 20X0 (beginning of 20X1):
- Defined benefit obligation: $1,200,000
- Fair value of plan assets: $1,190,000
- Net defined benefit liability: $1,200,000 - $1,190,000 = $10,000

Net interest for 20X1 = $10,000 × 10% = $1,000

The calculation should use the opening balance (31 December 20X0), not the closing balance, as we're calculating interest for the year 20X1.

## Question 06 of 16

Choose the correct words in order to show how to calculate the net defined benefit liability (asset).

Select and drag the best responses from the suggestions below into the blanks, and then click Submit.

The net defined benefit liability (asset) recognized in the statement of financial position is the net total of [___________] of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date Less the [___________] at the reporting date of plan assets (if any).

Options:
- cost
- fair value
- present value

**Correct Answer:** 
- First blank: **present value**
- Second blank: **fair value**

**Explanation:** According to IAS 19, the net defined benefit liability (asset) is calculated as:
- The **present value** of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date
- Less the **fair value** of plan assets at the reporting date (if any)

This is the fundamental formula for determining the amount to recognize in the statement of financial position for defined benefit plans. The obligation is measured at present value (discounted), while plan assets are measured at fair value.

## Question 07 of 16

Determine the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability for Edge Group's defined benefit plan that should be recognized in the other comprehensive income of Edge Group's financial statements during 20X1.

Select the Document icon to read the details of Edge Group's defined benefit plan.

What is the correct value for the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability?

### IAS 19e: Edge_group

#### Edge Group's defined benefit plan

Financial year end: 31 December 20X1.

Present value of defined benefit obligation
• At 31 December 20X0: $5,100,000
• At 31 December 20X1: $5,450,000

Fair value of plan assets
• At 31 December 20X0: $5,000,000
• At 31 December 20X1: $5,580,000

In 20X1:
• Current service cost: $750,000 (no past service cost and gain or loss on settlement was incurred in 20X1)
• Discount rate with reference to high quality corporate bond yield for 20X1: 10%
• Benefits paid by plan: $820,000
• Contributions paid into plan: $700,000
• Net interest cost on the net defined benefit liability: $10,000
• Actual rate of return on plan asset: 4% (for simplicity, the rate has been taking into account the net interest on the net defined benefit liability)

Actuarial gains and losses
• Actuarial gain on present value of obligation during 20X1: $90,000
• No material change in the effect of the asset ceiling was noted in 20X1.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ $200,000: $5,000,000 × 4%
○ $280,000: $5,000,000 × 4% + $90,000 – $10,000
○ $90,000
○ $300,000: $5,000,000 × 4% + $90,000 + $10,000
○ $290,000: $5,000,000 × 4% + $90,000 ✓

**Correct Answer: $290,000: $5,000,000 × 4% + $90,000**

**Explanation:** Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability recognized in OCI include:

1. **Actuarial gain on obligation**: $90,000
2. **Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest)**:
   - Expected return (included in net interest): $5,000,000 × 10% = $500,000
   - Actual return: $5,000,000 × 4% = $200,000
   - Difference (loss on plan assets): $200,000 - $500,000 = -$300,000
   
   However, the actual return of 4% already takes into account the net interest on the net defined benefit liability. So the actual return on plan assets is $200,000.

Total remeasurements = $200,000 (return on plan assets) + $90,000 (actuarial gain) = $290,000

These remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

Select the Document icon to revisit the details about Edge Group's defined benefit plan, and then calculate the net defined benefit expense that should be recognized in Edge Group's profit or loss during 20X1 (assuming that no amounts are capitalized under another IFRS Standard).

What is the correct value for the net defined benefit expense that should be recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that another IFRS Standard requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset?

### IAS 19e: Edge_group (Same information as Question 7)

#### Edge Group's defined benefit plan

Financial year end: 31 December 20X1.

Present value of defined benefit obligation

○ $760,000: $750,000 + $10,000 ✓

**Correct Answer: $760,000: $750,000 + $10,000**

**Explanation:** The net defined benefit expense recognized in profit or loss comprises:

1. **Current service cost**: $750,000
2. **Net interest on the net defined benefit liability**: $10,000
3. **Past service cost**: $0 (none incurred)
4. **Gain or loss on settlement**: $0 (none incurred)

Total expense in P&L = $750,000 + $10,000 = $760,000

Note that actuarial gains/losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest) are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), NOT in profit or loss. Therefore, the $90,000 actuarial gain and the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets are not included in the P&L expense.

**Explicación Corregida:** Para otros beneficios a largo plazo, según IAS 19:

La **responsabilidad/activo reconocido en el estado de situación financiera** es simplemente:
- El valor presente de la obligación por beneficio definido en la fecha de reporte
- Menos: El valor razonable de los activos del plan en la fecha de reporte (si los hay)

Esto NO es "Remeasurements" - es el monto neto total de la obligación menos los activos.

Para otros beneficios a largo plazo:
- El estado de situación financiera muestra: PV de obligación - FV de activos del plan
- En PyG se reconoce: Costo del servicio + Interés neto + Remediciones (todo va a PyG)
- NO hay reconocimiento en OCI (a diferencia de planes de beneficio definido post-empleo)

Las opciones de la pregunta están mal planteadas. La respuesta más cercana sería "Fair value at the reporting date of plan assets and reimbursement rights" pero tampoco es técnicamente correcta porque sería el valor presente de la obligación MENOS el valor razonable de los activos.

## Question 10 of 16

Colt Int. provides an employee benefit, payable on termination of service, equal to 1% of final salary for each year of service. If termination of service is involuntary, this employee benefit is increased to 2% of final salary for each year of service.

How should Colt Int. classify and hence account for these employee benefits?

Select the best responses from the drop-downs, and then click Submit.

The 1% received on voluntary termination should be treated as a [_____________] benefit.

The additional 1% received on involuntary redundancy should be treated as a [_____________] benefit.

Options:
- short-term employee
- post-employment
- other long-term employee
- termination

**Correct Answer:**
- First blank: **post-employment**
- Second blank: **termination**

**Explanation:** 
- The **1% received on voluntary termination** is a **post-employment benefit** because it's payable when the employee leaves voluntarily (retirement or resignation). This is a defined benefit that accumulates with service and is payable after employment ends.

- The **additional 1% for involuntary redundancy** is a **termination benefit** because:
  - It's only payable when the entity terminates the employment (involuntary)
  - It's compensation for the loss of employment at the entity's decision
  - It's not earned through service but triggered by the termination event
  - IAS 19 specifically states that benefits enhanced in exchange for termination are termination benefits

The base 1% vests through service (post-employment), while the additional 1% is contingent on involuntary termination (termination benefit).

## Question 11 of 16

Under a defined contribution plan, the Beta Trading is obligated to pay a contribution equal to 4% of gross earnings. Once the contributions have been paid, the Beta Trading has no further payment obligations.

The following details are available:
• Gross Earnings during 20X1 is $10,000,000;
• Cash Payment during 20X1 is $450,000; and
• Prepaid Expense as of 31 December 20X0 was $50,000.

What is the appropriate journal entry for Beta Trading's contributions made in 20X1?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Debit: Expense    $350,000
   Credit: Cash      $350,000

○ Debit: Expense            $350,000
   Debit: Prepaid expense    $50,000
   Credit: Cash              $400,000

○ Debit: Expense    $400,000
   Credit: Cash      $400,000

○ Debit: Expense            $400,000
   Debit: Prepaid expense    $50,000
   Credit: Cash              $450,000 ✓

**CORRECCIÓN - Respuesta Correcta: La segunda opción**
**Debit: Expense $400,000**
**Debit: Prepaid expense $50,000**
**Credit: Cash $450,000**

**Explicación Corregida:** Para el plan de contribución definida:

1. **Contribución requerida para 20X1**: $10,000,000 × 4% = $400,000
2. **Pago en efectivo durante 20X1**: $450,000
3. **Gasto prepagado al 31 dic 20X0**: $50,000

El análisis correcto es:
- Al inicio de 20X1 hay un prepago de $50,000 del año anterior
- La obligación de 20X1 es $400,000
- Se pagaron $450,000 en efectivo durante 20X1

Por lo tanto, el asiento contable debe reflejar:
- **Debit: Expense $400,000** - El gasto del año actual
- **Debit: Prepaid expense $50,000** - Nuevo prepago ($450,000 pagado - $400,000 obligación)
- **Credit: Cash $450,000** - El efectivo realmente pagado

Esto resulta en un nuevo prepago de $50,000 al final de 20X1 para el siguiente período.

La respuesta que marcamos inicialmente era incorrecta porque no reflejaba el pago real en efectivo de $450,000.

## Question 12 of 16

Which of the following are short-term employee benefits?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Lump sum retirement benefit payments that vest after a certain number of years of service

○ Paid leave where absences occur within 15 months after the end of the period in which employees render the service

○ Non-monetary benefits (e.g., medical care, housing, cars, and free or subsidized goods or services) for current employees ✓

○ Profit-sharing and bonuses payable 12 months or more after the end of the period of the employee service

○ Deferred compensation payable more than 12 months after the period in which it is earned

**Correct Answer: Non-monetary benefits (e.g., medical care, housing, cars, and free or subsidized goods or services) for current employees**

**Explanation:** According to IAS 19, short-term employee benefits are those expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which employees render the related service. 

- **Non-monetary benefits for current employees** are short-term benefits because they are provided and consumed during employment.

The other options are NOT short-term benefits:
- **Lump sum retirement benefits**: These are post-employment benefits
- **Paid leave within 15 months**: Exceeds the 12-month threshold, making it an other long-term benefit
- **Profit-sharing/bonuses payable after 12 months**: These are other long-term benefits
- **Deferred compensation payable after 12 months**: This is an other long-term benefit

The key criterion is the 12-month settlement period after the reporting period.

## Question 13 of 16

A payment of benefits is made out of plan assets in settlement of part of the entity's obligation to pay such benefits.

Select the correct journal entry for an entity making benefit payments of $15,000 out of a defined benefit plan during the year.

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Debit: Defined benefit obligation    $15,000
   Credit: Plan assets                  $15,000 ✓

○ Debit: Plan assets                   $15,000
   Credit: Defined benefit obligation   $15,000

○ Debit: Plan assets                   $15,000
   Credit: Cash                        $15,000

○ Debit: Cash                          $15,000
   Credit: Plan assets                  $15,000

**Correct Answer: Debit: Defined benefit obligation $15,000 / Credit: Plan assets $15,000**

**Explanation:** When benefits are paid directly from plan assets to beneficiaries:

1. The **defined benefit obligation decreases** (debit) because the entity has fulfilled part of its obligation to pay benefits
2. The **plan assets decrease** (credit) because assets have been used to pay the benefits

This entry reflects that $15,000 of benefits have been paid out, reducing both:
- The obligation the entity has to employees
- The assets held in the plan to fund those obligations

The other options are incorrect because:
- Benefits paid reduce (not increase) both the obligation and plan assets
- No cash from the entity is involved when benefits are paid directly from plan assets
- The plan doesn't receive cash; it pays out benefits

## Question 14 of 16

Choose the correct words in order to show how to determine the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset) or the other long-term benefit:

Select and drag the best responses from the suggestions below into the blanks, and then click Submit.

Accounting for [___________]: an entity shall recognize the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) in profit or loss.

Accounting for [___________]: an entity shall recognize the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) in other comprehensive income.

Options:
- termination benefit
- other long-term benefit
- defined benefit plan
- defined contribution plan

**Correct Answer:**
- First blank: **other long-term benefit**
- Second blank: **defined benefit plan**

**Explanation:** According to IAS 19:

1. **Other long-term employee benefits**: All remeasurements are recognized immediately in **profit or loss**. This is a simplified approach compared to post-employment benefits.

2. **Defined benefit plans** (post-employment): Remeasurements (actuarial gains/losses and return on plan assets excluding amounts in net interest) are recognized in **other comprehensive income (OCI)** and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

Key differences:
- Other long-term benefits → Remeasurements go to P&L
- Defined benefit plans → Remeasurements go to OCI
- Termination benefits don't have remeasurements (recognized when criteria are met)
- Defined contribution plans don't have remeasurements (only fixed contributions)

## Question 15 of 16

Shooting Star Corporation announces its decision to close a factory and terminate the employment of all 200 employees as a result of the economic downturn. Shooting Star will pay $20,000 per employee upon termination. However, to ensure the wind-up of the factory occurs smoothly and all remaining customer orders are completed, the entity needs to retain at least 20% of employees until the closure of the factory in eight months. As a result, the entity announced in a corporate memo to all employees that employees that agree to stay until the closure of the factory will receive another $10,000 payment in addition to the $20,000 on the termination date, along with their current wage throughout that period of service.

Which of the following should be classified as termination benefit under IAS 19?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ The incremental amount of $10,000 to be paid to employees that agree to stay until the closure of the factory

○ Both the incremental amount of $10,000 to be paid to employees that agree to stay until the closure of the factory and the payment of $20,000 upon termination

○ Payment of $20,000 upon termination ✓

○ The current wage to be paid throughout that period of service

**Correct Answer: Payment of $20,000 upon termination**

**Explanation:** According to IAS 19:

- **$20,000 payment upon termination** is a **termination benefit** because it's paid as a result of the entity's decision to terminate employment (factory closure).

The other items are NOT termination benefits:
- **$10,000 incremental payment** for staying is compensation for future services (8 months until closure), making it a short-term employee benefit, not a termination benefit
- **Current wages** during the 8-month period are short-term employee benefits for services rendered

IAS 19 distinguishes between:
- Benefits paid for termination of employment (termination benefits)
- Benefits paid for services to be provided (employee benefits)

The $10,000 and wages are contingent on employees providing services until closure, while the $20,000 is paid regardless, purely for termination.

## Question 16 of 16

Rouge Co. is required to pay a contribution equal to 3% of salaries into a plan. Once the contributions have been paid, the entity has no further payment obligations.

• Total salaries of all employees under Benefit Plan in 20X1: $1,000,000
• Total payments into the plan in 20X1: $30,000

There was no asset or liability for prepaid/outstanding contributions at 31 December 20X0.

What expense and liability, if any, should be recognized under this plan?

Select the best response, and then click Submit.

○ Expense $30,000; Liability $0 ✓
○ Expense $30,000; Liability $30,000
○ Expense $0; Liability $30,000
○ Expense $0; Liability $0

**Correct Answer: Expense $30,000; Liability $0**

**Explanation:** This is a defined contribution plan. The analysis is:

1. **Required contribution for 20X1**: $1,000,000 × 3% = $30,000
2. **Amount paid in 20X1**: $30,000
3. **Beginning balance**: $0 (no prepaid or outstanding at 31 Dec 20X0)

Since Rouge Co.:
- Paid exactly what was required ($30,000)
- Had no beginning balance
- Has no further obligation once contributions are paid

The accounting treatment is:
- **Expense**: $30,000 (the obligation for 20X1)
- **Liability**: $0 (obligation fully settled by payment)

The journal entry would be:
Dr. Expense $30,000
Cr. Cash $30,000

No liability remains at year-end as the full obligation has been paid.

### Key Learnings from Errors:

**Question 9:** Para otros beneficios a largo plazo, el pasivo/activo en el estado de situación financiera es el valor presente de la obligación menos el valor razonable de los activos del plan, no "remediciones" que es un componente del gasto.

**Question 11:** En planes de contribución definida, cuando hay prepagos del período anterior y se paga más de la obligación actual, el asiento debe reflejar:
- El gasto del período actual
- El nuevo prepago como un débito
- El efectivo total pagado como crédito
No se puede simplificar mostrando solo el gasto y efectivo neto.
